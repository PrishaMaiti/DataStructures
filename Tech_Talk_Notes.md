# Tech Talk 0 Data Structures
- There are two main paradigms for programming: imperative which is considered with the state of the program and how it works, and object-oriented which, as the name suggest, is centered around classes and objects.
- We've been working with Java, which is an OOP.
- Procedural programming, a particular type of imperative programming, is NOT the same as functional programming
- Languages like Swift are functional programming languages

# Tech Talk 1: Linked Lists Part 2
- Linked lists make up Stacks and Queues
- Enqueued data adds a tail word to the end of the word phrase: seven slimy snakes sallying slowly slithered southward
- Dequeued data reverses the order: tail remains constant and head changes
- Logic of queues is First In First Out (FIFO)
- Logic of stacks is Last In First Out (LIFO) or Push and Pop
- We have to build our own stack
- The first object in the queue: their previous node would be null, then their next node would be the next object in the queue. That object's previous node would be the previous object and then their next node would be null if there's no next object stacked or the next object if it is stacked
- Each object has to be linked to each other, not just previous to next
