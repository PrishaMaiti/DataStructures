## Question 4
# Correct Answer: C
# What I Answered: D
# Reasoning: I chose C without acknowledging that negative values can be a part of the int array too. I immediately thought that the largest value in arr being 0 would cause and ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception, when in reality that's not true. With negative numbers, the logic of if val > maxVal would not function correctly.

## Question 5
# Correct Answer: A
# What I Answered: C
# Reasoning: As per DeMorgan's laws, x or y and x "cancels out" the y. I on the other hand just switched out the or operator for the and operator.
