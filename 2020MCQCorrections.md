## Question 3
### Correct Answer: C
### What I Answered: E
### Reasoning: The distance between the two markers is what should be positive, since we're dealing with distance which is a scalar quantity, before finally doing division by double 60.0.

## Question 6
### Correct Answer: A
### What I Answered: D
### Reasoning: In Statement I, it's only the int 2 where the double casting applies, so when we do the math, we would get 3.5. 2/4 and 2/4 + 3 are not the expressions that should be casted to double, since mathematically statements II and III do not yield the result 3.5.

## Question 7
### Correct Answer: E
### What I Answered: B
### Reasoning: E is correct because the conditions of num being between 0 and 100 exclusive allows b2 to remain true. Every other condition has turned b1 false.

## Question 8
### Correct Answer: D
### What I Answered: B
### Reasoning: For B, it's the other way around. Doubles cannot be assigned to ints but ints can still be assigned to doubles. However, n1 and n2 are not defined, but are rather only used for the Points class constructor.
