## Question 3
### Correct Answer: C
### What I Answered: E
### Reasoning: The distance between the two markers is what should be positive, since we're dealing with distance which is a scalar quantity, before finally doing division by double 60.0.

## Question 6
### Correct Answer: A
### What I Answered: D
### Reasoning: In Statement I, it's only the int 2 where the double casting applies, so when we do the math, we would get 3.5. 2/4 and 2/4 + 3 are not the expressions that should be casted to double, since mathematically statements II and III do not yield the result 3.5.

## Question 7
### Correct Answer: E
### What I Answered: B
### Reasoning: E is correct because the conditions of num being between 0 and 100 exclusive allows b2 to remain true. Every other condition has turned b1 false.

## Question 8
### Correct Answer: D
### What I Answered: B
### Reasoning: For B, it's the other way around. Doubles cannot be assigned to ints but ints can still be assigned to doubles. However, n1 and n2 are not defined, but are rather only used for the Points class constructor.

## Question 9
### Correct Answer: B
### What I Answered: C
### Reasoning: I made a calculation mistake with the final digit. I just redid it and got 1 for the final digit.

## Question 10
### Correct Answer: D
### What I Answered: B
### Reasoning: If 5 and 10 were num1 and num2 respectively, only 0 will be printed. 20 and 5 however, the first output will still be 0, and when i = 10, 10 will be printed.

## Question 12
### Correct Answer: B
### What I Answered: C
### Reasoning: III is incorrect because we need the object itself to not equal null, not just the attribute of its name. Hence II is correct.

## Question 14
### Correct Answer: D
### What I Answered: A
### Reasoning: The reason why III works as well is because in this context, not having the else keyword the way it's implemented in I would not affect the code's logic. Once again, statement II will not work because a static method cannot have a return type.

## Question 16
### Correct Answer: B
### What I Answered: D
### Reasoning: The number of asterisks are printed the other way around as per the order of where the recursive method call is in the method.
