# Sorting Code

## Bubble Sort
In the bubble sort algorithm, two adjacent elements are compared and a swap is done if necessary to sort the data structure into a particular order. Once the entire data structure is traversed, that counts as one pass. The algorithm then executes a second pass. If no swaps are executed in a pass, that becomes the final pass and the bubble sort algorithm ends. There always needs to be a final pass with 0 swaps in order for the computer to guarantee that the data structure is in order, even though we as humans can already see it's in order after the final sort. The folowing code snippet shows my algorithm using a nested for loop in a method written, conveniently named bubbleSort().
