Step 1: Go to College Board

- For each unit, review the MCQ and FRQ
- For MCQ, spend more time on what I got wrong than what I got right and understand why I got it wrong and what needs to be done to get it right next time
- For FRQ, go to Repl and see what code I have written for each FRQ. Why did certain files of code not run? What do I need to study about Java to be able to complete each FRQ in no more than 20 minutes?
Step 2: Review Journals of Tri 1 and Tri 2

- For Tri 1 journal, review test corrections and unit highlights. This will help me understand which units I did worse on in the MCQ and therefore go back to College Board and study those units more
- For Tri 2 journal, compare code originally written with corrections. Why did I originally think the first way? Why is the second way correct?
Step 3: Review Backend Code of PBL

- Study the backend code from Tri 1 PBL that allowed for an API to fetch Spotify's New Music Friday playlist
- Study the backend code from Tri 2 PBL that allowed the quiz games to be created
